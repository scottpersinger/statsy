===== Data Model ========

User
  - record of a user account
Domain
  - record of one root domain to be tracked
  - many: pages
Page
  - description of a tracked page in a domain
Conversion
  - Defines a conversion
Visit
  - record of one visit by one visitor on a given day. Records
  the landing page and referral. There could be multiple visits
  by the same visitor on the same day.
Pageviews
  - aggregates page views/visits to a page on a given day. So there
  is 1 record per Page per day.
Conversion
  - records details of a single conversion from a given day.


Example
-------
Suppose we have site, example.com. It has 4 pages:
  / (home page)
  /products (product listing page)
  /purchase (purchase page with form)
  /confirm (purchase confirmation page)

And suppose we get 3 visits from 2 visitors to this site on 2010-01-01,
and one conversion (purchase).

Then we have this data:

CONFIG

domains [
  {:domain => 'example.com', :user_id => }
]

pages [
  {:domain_id => , :path => "/', :pattern => }
  {:domain_id => , :path => "/products', :pattern => }
  {:domain_id => , :path => "/purchase', :pattern => }
  {:domain_id => , :path => "/confirm', :pattern => }

conversions [
  {:domain_id => , :page_id => , :name => "purchase"}

AFTER COLLECTION

domains [
  {:domain => 'example.com', :visitor_count => 2}
]

visits [
  {:day => 20100101,
  :time => time,
  :landing_page => /,
  :prior_visit_id => ,
  :referral, :source},

  {:day => 20100101,
  :time => time,
  :landing_page => /,
  :prior_visit_id => (points to previous visit),
  :referral, :source},

  {:day => 20100101,
  :time => time,
  :landing_page => /products,
  :prior_visit_id => ,
  :referral, :source}
]

pageviews [
  {:day => 20100101,
  :page => /,
  :views => 2,
  :visits => 1},

  {:day => 20100101,
  :page => /products,
  :views => 3,
  :visits => 2,
  :exits => 1,
  :time_on_page => 35,

  :referrals => [
    / => 2
  ]},

  {:day => '2010101',
  :page => /purchase,
  :views => 2,
  :visits => 2,
  :exits => 1,
  :referrals => [
    /product => 2
  ],

  {:day => 20100101,
  :page => /confirm,
  :views => 1,
  :visits => 1,
  :exits => 1,
  :referrals => [
    /purchase => 1
  ]}
]

conversions [
  {:day => 20100101,
  :conversion_id => ,
  :page_id => ,
  :time => time,
  :time_to_convert => time - visit time
  :visit_id =>}
]


Landing page
------------
If the referrer is not from this domain, we consider the pageview a "landing".
If the user has no "last page" cookie (good for 30 mins), then we generate
a Visit (and a Pageview). Then we set a "last page" cookie to the current page,
good for 30 minutes.

Internal page view
------------------
If the referrer is from this domain, then we generate a Pageview. We lookup
the previous page based on the referrer, and do a few things:
  -Increment exits for the current page
  -Decrement exits for the referring page.
  -Increment the views number for the current page.
  -Add the referrer to "referrals" for the current page, and increment the total.
  -The client calculates time_on_page for the referring page, and we record that

Calculations
------------
  Total visits per day: count of visits_days for day =
  Total pageviews: sum(views) over pageviews_days for day =
  Top pages:
    pageviews_days ranked by visits where day =
  Conversions:
    count of conversions_days grouped by conversion_id

  Funnel:
    For a conversion:
      for each page tagged for a conversion:
        conversion rate = conversions / page visits
        backtrack by referrals to page, divide page visits / referral page visits
